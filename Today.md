## CVE-2024-5596
 The ARMember Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.7. This is due to incorrectly implemented nonce validation function on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify, or delete user meta and plugin options which can lead to limited privilege escalation.

## CVE-2023-45819
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE&#8217;s Notification Manager API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system, which is used in error handling. The conditions for this exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered. When a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user. This issue could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display unfiltered HTML content. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed in the notification is sanitized, preventing the exploit. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2009-2265
 Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in FCKeditor before 2.6.4.1 allow remote attackers to create executable files in arbitrary directories via directory traversal sequences in the input to unspecified connector modules, as exploited in the wild for remote code execution in July 2009, related to the file browser and the editor/filemanager/connectors/ directory.
