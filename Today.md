## CVE-2024-56924
 A Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Code Astro Internet banking system 2.0.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the admin page (pages_account), potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as changing account settings or stealing sensitive user information. This vulnerability occurs due to improper validation of user requests, which enables attackers to exploit the system by tricking the admin user into executing malicious scripts.

## CVE-2024-6460
 The Grow by Tradedoubler  WordPress plugin through 2.0.21 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion via the component parameter. This makes it possible for attackers to include and execute PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
