## CVE-2024-5124
 A timing attack vulnerability exists in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt repository, specifically within the password comparison logic. The vulnerability is present in version 20240310 of the software, where passwords are compared using the '=' operator in Python. This method of comparison allows an attacker to guess passwords based on the timing of each character's comparison. The issue arises from the code segment that checks a password for a particular username, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially guess user passwords, compromising the security of the system.

## CVE-2024-1168
 The SEOPress &#8211; On-site SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's social image URL in all versions up to, and including, 7.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied image URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE-2024-1091
 The ImageRecycle pdf &amp; image compression plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the reinitialize function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to remove all plugin data.

## CVE-2023-50387
 Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the &quot;KeyTrap&quot; issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.

## CVE-2023-32784
 In KeePass 2.x before 2.54, it is possible to recover the cleartext master password from a memory dump, even when a workspace is locked or no longer running. The memory dump can be a KeePass process dump, swap file (pagefile.sys), hibernation file (hiberfil.sys), or RAM dump of the entire system. The first character cannot be recovered. In 2.54, there is different API usage and/or random string insertion for mitigation.

## CVE-2022-1386
 The Fusion Builder WordPress plugin before 3.6.2, used in the Avada theme, does not validate a parameter in its forms which could be used to initiate arbitrary HTTP requests. The data returned is then reflected back in the application's response. This could be used to interact with hosts on the server's local network bypassing firewalls and access control measures.
