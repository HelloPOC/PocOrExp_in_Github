## CVE-2024-4865
 The Happy Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the &#8216;_id&#8217; parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE-2024-4841
 A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui, specifically within the 'add_reference_to_local_mode' function due to the lack of input sanitization. This vulnerability affects versions v9.6 to the latest. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can predict the folders, subfolders, and files present on the victim's computer. The vulnerability is present in the way the application handles the 'path' parameter in HTTP requests to the '/add_reference_to_local_model' endpoint.

## CVE-2021-32708
 Flysystem is an open source file storage library for PHP. The whitespace normalisation using in 1.x and 2.x removes any unicode whitespace. Under certain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious user to execute code remotely. The conditions are: A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file, the supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars, the supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list, the supplied path or filename contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file is stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given these conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack. The unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a rejection (exception). For 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users, upgrade to 2.1.1.
