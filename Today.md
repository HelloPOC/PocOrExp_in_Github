## CVE-2024-4890
 A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm application, specifically within the '/team/update' process. The vulnerability arises due to the improper handling of the 'user_id' parameter in the raw SQL query used for deleting users. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL commands through the 'user_id' parameter, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive information such as API keys, user information, and tokens stored in the database.
