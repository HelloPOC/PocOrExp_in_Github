## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2013-5211
 The monlist feature in ntp_request.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.7p26 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via forged (1) REQ_MON_GETLIST or (2) REQ_MON_GETLIST_1 requests, as exploited in the wild in December 2013.

## CVE-2013-0269
 The JSON gem before 1.5.5, 1.6.x before 1.6.8, and 1.7.x before 1.7.7 for Ruby allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) or bypass the mass assignment protection mechanism via a crafted JSON document that triggers the creation of arbitrary Ruby symbols or certain internal objects, as demonstrated by conducting a SQL injection attack against Ruby on Rails, aka &quot;Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability.&quot;

## CVE-2010-2075
 UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1, as distributed on certain mirror sites from November 2009 through June 2010, contains an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) in the DEBUG3_DOLOG_SYSTEM macro, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

## CVE-2001-1473
 The SSH-1 protocol allows remote servers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and replay a client challenge response to a target server by creating a Session ID that matches the Session ID of the target, but which uses a public key pair that is weaker than the target's public key, which allows the attacker to compute the corresponding private key and use the target's Session ID with the compromised key pair to masquerade as the target.
