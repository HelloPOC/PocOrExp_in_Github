## CVE-2022-21661
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MariaDB database.

Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 3.7.37. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
