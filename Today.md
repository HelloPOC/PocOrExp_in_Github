## CVE-2024-28116
 Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 is vulnerable to a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which allows any authenticated user (editor permissions are sufficient) to execute arbitrary code on the remote server bypassing the existing security sandbox. Version 1.7.45 contains a patch for this issue.

## CVE-2024-26304
 There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the underlying L2/L3 Management service that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets destined to the PAPI (Aruba's access point management protocol) UDP port (8211). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the ability to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.

## CVE-2023-30800
 The web server used by MikroTik RouterOS version 6 is affected by a heap memory corruption issue. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can corrupt the server's heap memory by sending a crafted HTTP request. As a result, the web interface crashes and is immediately restarted. The issue was fixed in RouterOS 6.49.10 stable. RouterOS version 7 is not affected.

## CVE-2021-43798
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0 (except for patched versions) iss vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to local files. The vulnerable URL path is: `&lt;grafana_host_url&gt;/public/plugins//`, where is the plugin ID for any installed plugin. At no time has Grafana Cloud been vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, or 8.3.1. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more information about vulnerable URL paths, mitigation, and the disclosure timeline.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
