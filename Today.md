## CVE-2025-0924
 The WP Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘message’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE-2025-0411
The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25456.

## CVE-2024-23724
 Ghost through 5.76.0 allows stored XSS, and resultant privilege escalation in which a contributor can take over any account, via an SVG profile picture that contains JavaScript code to interact with the API on localhost TCP port 3001. NOTE: The discoverer reports that "The vendor does not view this as a valid vector."

## CVE-2024-10924
 The Really Simple Security (Free, Pro, and Pro Multisite) plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions 9.0.0 to 9.1.1.1. This is due to improper user check error handling in the two-factor REST API actions with the 'check_login_and_get_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, when the "Two-Factor Authentication" setting is enabled (disabled by default).

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
