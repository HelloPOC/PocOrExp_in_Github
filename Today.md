## CVE-2024-21626
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (&quot;attack 2&quot;). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (&quot;attack 1&quot;). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (&quot;attack 3a&quot; and &quot;attack 3b&quot;). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.
