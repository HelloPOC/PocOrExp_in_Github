## CVE-2024-1168
 The SEOPress &#8211; On-site SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's social image URL in all versions up to, and including, 7.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied image URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE-2024-1092
 The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy &#8211; Feed to Post, Autoblogging, News &amp; YouTube Video Feeds Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check on the feedzy dashboard in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to create, edit or delete feed categories created by them.

## CVE-2024-1091
 The ImageRecycle pdf &amp; image compression plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the reinitialize function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to remove all plugin data.

## CVE-2024-1054
 The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wcj_product_barcode' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 7.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes like 'color'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE-2023-2163
 Incorrect verifier pruning in BPF in Linux Kernel &gt;=5.4 leads to unsafe code paths being incorrectly marked as safe, resulting in arbitrary read/write in kernel memory, lateral privilege escalation, and container escape.

## CVE-2021-3490
 The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e (&quot;bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations&quot;) (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 (&quot;bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking&quot;) (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 (&quot;bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor&quot;) ( 5.10-rc1).

## CVE-2019-5736
 runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.

## CVE-2018-13379
 An Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (&quot;Path Traversal&quot;) in Fortinet FortiOS 6.0.0 to 6.0.4, 5.6.3 to 5.6.7 and 5.4.6 to 5.4.12 and FortiProxy 2.0.0, 1.2.0 to 1.2.8, 1.1.0 to 1.1.6, 1.0.0 to 1.0.7 under SSL VPN web portal allows an unauthenticated attacker to download system files via special crafted HTTP resource requests.
