## CVE-2024-3183
 A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ is encrypted using the client&#8217;s session key. This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user&#8217;s password. If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal&#8217;s password).

## CVE-2021-44142
 The Samba vfs_fruit module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide &quot;...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver.&quot; Samba versions prior to 4.13.17, 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 with vfs_fruit configured allow out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes. A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of smbd, typically root.

## CVE-2021-3129
 Ignition before 2.5.2, as used in Laravel and other products, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of insecure usage of file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(). This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2.
